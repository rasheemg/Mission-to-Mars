# Mission-to-Mars


Here I used web scraping to extract online data. Using Chrome Developer tools to identify HTML components, Beautifulsoup and Splinter to automate and scrape, Mongo to store the data, and Flask to display data we extracted information from active websites. I used these tools to quickly extract data instead of manually going to individual websites one by one. Focusing on HTML CSS and additional libraries I scraped Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles, Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles, and Added Bootstrap 3 Components.
